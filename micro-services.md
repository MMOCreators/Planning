# How many Micro-services do we need?
Why are we asking this Question? Your prolly wondering, but at this stage your giving yourself the ability to set the `Baseline` difficulty for the project. The more you add, the harder it will be, and the longer it will take. Take into consideration, not only sprints but also into the difficulty in what your asking. You should ask this question sooner in your `Planning` process, rather then later.
