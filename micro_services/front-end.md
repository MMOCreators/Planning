### Front-end
#### Reason
In order to be able to explain things about the MMO, we need a simple page that does not show much, but allows users to register, and login showing the ability to download a file to the client.
#### Endpoints
* /
	* Reason: Base page that showcases images, videos, and a small blurb of information about the project, includes Social Media Links and Various things.
* /login
	* Reason: Need to beable to Login, this will be just to show Account Standing for now via /account
* /register
	* Reason: Need to beable to Register for the Game, this will trigger a Email to Validate Account.
* /profile
	* Reason: Shows current Account Standing, ability to Change Display name only for Logged-in Users.
#### Extras
Would love to add a Activation Key Module to allow for users to activate various things for alpha/beta/etc.
